How to get Sendgrid running with a dev version hosted on Heroku (NOTE: We're no longer using Sendgrid for all mailings.)
========================================================================

While logged into Heroku on the command line (using the same email registered under Sendgrid) please run:

```
heroku addons:create sendgrid:starter
```

This automatically associates the Sendgrid service with the Heroku account. After which,

```
heroku addons
```

will confirm that the Sendgrid is hooked up with Heroku.

Once that is confirmed, running:

```
heroku config:get SENDGRID_USERNAME
heroku config:get SENDGRID_PASSWORD
```

will pull a random username and password automatically generated by Sendgrid to be plugged in as ENV variables. The initializer file I created (setup_mail.rb) then configures the Heroku app for use with Sendgrid.

I installed the Figaro gem to hide Sendgrid credentials on Github. Running
```
bundle
```
then

```
figaro install
```
generates an application.yml file to place the Sendgrid username and password retrieved earlier with the heroku config command. (I created application.example.yml to show what needs to be placed locally in application.yml)

Since this app was created with an older version of rails, a secret token was generated in config/initializers/secret_token.rb.

Thus, I ran

```
rake secret
```
to generate a new token and updated application.yml with the new token as well.

After following these steps, I was able to get Sendgrid running in a dev environment, as well as use the dashboard on the Sendgrid site to con rm which emails went out. Please let me know if you need anything!
